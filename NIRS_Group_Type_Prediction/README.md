# NIRS-based Cognitive State Classification


## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)** based classification to distinguish between cognitive states during dual-task performance. Using hemodynamic signals, we predict whether participants are operating under **goal-directed (AO)** or **exploratory (SO)** cognitive conditions.

### 🎯 Key Achievements
- **64.7% accuracy** with Random Forest (best performing model)
- **75.0% recall** for positive class detection
- **1024-channel NIRS** comprehensive hemodynamic monitoring
- **Real-time inference** capability (< 1s prediction time)

## 🔍 Feature Engineering Pipeline

### 1. Channel-Level Features (per detector-channel pair)

#### Basic Hemodynamic Statistics
```python
# Temporal averages
RED_mean = np.mean(RED_signal)
IR_mean = np.mean(IR_signal)

# Hemoglobin concentrations
HbO_mean = RED_mean - IR_mean  # Oxygenated hemoglobin
HbR_mean = IR_mean - RED_mean  # Deoxygenated hemoglobin

# Signal variability
RED_std = np.std(RED_signal)
IR_std = np.std(IR_signal)
```

#### Temporal Dynamics
```python
# First-order differences
RED_diff = np.diff(RED_signal)
RED_diff_std = np.std(RED_diff)  # Temporal variability
```

#### Spectral Analysis
```python
from scipy.signal import welch

# Power Spectral Density (4s Hanning window)
frequencies, psd = welch(RED_signal, fs=4, nperseg=16)
PSD_peak = np.max(psd)
PSD_peak_freq = frequencies[np.argmax(psd)]
```

### 2. Global Features (aggregated across channels)

```python
# Cross-detector statistics
global_RED_mean = np.mean([RED_mean for all detectors])
global_RED_std = np.std([RED_mean for all detectors])
global_RED_IR_ratio = global_RED_mean / (global_IR_mean + 1e-10)
```

### 3. Feature Vector Composition

├── Global aggregates (12 features)

## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Confusion Matrix (Random Forest)
```
                Predicted
                SO    AO
Actual  SO     11    10    ← 11 correct SO, 10 misclassified
        AO      5    17    ← 5 misclassified, 17 correct AO
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **True Negative (SO correctly identified):** 11
- **False Positive (SO misclassified as AO):** 10  
- **False Negative (AO misclassified as SO):** 5
- **True Positive (AO correctly identified):** 17

#### ⚠️ Limitations
- **Moderate Precision**: Some false positives (SO → AO misclassification)
- **Class Imbalance Sensitivity**: Performance varies with dataset composition
- **Feature Dimensionality**: High-dimensional feature space requires regularization

### Comparison with EEG Modality
| Metric | Best NIRS Model | Best EEG Model | Difference |
|--------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Accuracy | 64.7% | **81.0%** | -16.3% |
| F1-Score | 65.3% | **83.3%** | -18.0% |
| Training Time | 0.55s | **0.024s** | +22.9× slower |
| Inference Time | <1s | <1s | Comparable |

**EEG shows superior performance, but NIRS provides complementary hemodynamic information**
